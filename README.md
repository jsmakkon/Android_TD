# Unity Mobile Project: Tower Defense

This project is a tower defense game with some RPG elements and randomized environment. The purpose of the project is to explore features of the Unity when developing for mobile devices. This project is developed with 2 persons.

The idea of the project is to create a tower defense game with random elements, like randomized maps and items, while also mixing RPG elemnts by giving player a hero character to develope during the battle. The hero is able to fight approaching enemies, cast spells, provide auras to tower or disturb enemies with them or bring passive effects. The hero doesn't get experience as usually, but gathers items to get the special abilities.
